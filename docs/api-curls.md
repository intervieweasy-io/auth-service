# API cURL Reference

The snippets below cover every HTTP endpoint exposed by the monolith. They assume the API is running
on `http://localhost:4000` and that you are using bash (or a compatible shell). Feel free to copy and
paste individual commands to exercise endpoints manually.

```bash
API_URL="http://localhost:4000"
```

Many routes require an access token. You can sign in once and reuse the bearer token + refresh cookie
for the remainder of your session:

```bash
# Log in and store the access token. Cookies (including refresh) are written to cookies.txt.
AUTH_TOKEN="$(curl -s -X POST "$API_URL/api/auth/login" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"changeme"}' \
  -c cookies.txt | jq -r '.access')"
```

> **Tip:** `cookies.txt` lets you refresh tokens without re-authenticating.

## Health Checks

```bash
# Monolith health probes
